# Structural-Bioinformatics

<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
The project has the following dependencies:
 <ul>
  <li>biopython</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>request</li>
  <li>subprocess</li>
  <li>joblib</li>
  <li>dssp</li>
  <li>torch</li>
  <li>torchinfo</li>
</ul> 

Make sure the above dependencies are installed before running the program.

<h3>Execution:</h3>
Before running the software you need to edit the "configuration.json" file in the "contacts_classification" folder. Specifically, it is necessary to modify the path of "dssp_file" by placing the path that points to the "mkdssp" dependency.
Before launching the program it is also necessary to check that there is at least one model in the "models/" folder (it must necessarily be one of those generated by the supplied ".ipynb" file.
At this point it will be possible to launch the program by executing the command "$python3 main.py" and follow the requests that will be displayed.


<h3>Re-train models:</h3>
To use new models with different training it is necessary to re-run the delivered ".ipynb" file and save the
models in the "models" project folder. At this point, just start the program and choose the desired model when prompted.
